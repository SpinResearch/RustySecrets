//! # Schemes

//! The two schemes differ by the security properties that they satisfy.
//! The following table summarizes which properties are satisfied by each scheme.
//! The definitions of the properties can be found under the 'Security properties' section.

//! **Property** | **Description**
//! :-----------:|----------------|----------------
//! **Basic**    | Basic correctness: If you attempt to recover a secret from an authorized set of shares that were obtained by sharing out a secret **M** using an access structure **A**, you're sure to get back **A** and **M**.<br> <em>Note: in this implementation **A** is not actually returned, but definitely could.</em>
//! **Priv1**    | Standard privacy notation: When the coins are used by the dealer are uniformly random, unauthorized sets of shares have no computationally extractable information about the underlying secret.
//! **Priv2**    | Privacy for deterministic or hedged schemes: extract whatever entropy one can from the underlying secret. If itâ€™s adequate, no additional randomness is needed in order to achieve a meaningful notion of privacy.
//! **Auth1**    | A share obtained from an honest dealer commits it to a single underlying secret: that and only that value can be recovered.
//! **Auth2**    | A share obtained even from a dishonest dealer commits it to a single underlying secret: that and only that value might be recovered. Implies Auth1.
//! **ErrDet**   | An inauthentic set of shares produced by an adversary will be flagged as such when fed to the recovery algorithm.
//! **Repro**    | Share reproducible: The scheme can produce shares in a deterministic way.
